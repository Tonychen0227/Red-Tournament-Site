<h2>Ascension Swiss Format</h2>
<p>This year, we'll be using running a new format called <strong>Ascension Swiss</strong>.
<p>All participants will take part in <strong>three rounds in the Group Stage</strong>.</p>
<p>There are two pools for the Swiss Rounds: <strong>Normal</strong> and <strong>Ascension</strong>. All players start in the <strong>Normal Pool</strong> in the first round, with matches being drawn completely randomly.</p>
<p>Winning your match in the <strong>Normal Pool</strong> in any round will advance you to the <strong>Ascension Pool</strong> for the next round, if applicable.</p>
<p>Winning your match in the <strong>Ascension Pool</strong> advances you straight to the <strong>Quarterfinals</strong>. Losing your match (coming in last place) will drop you down back to the <strong>Normal Pool</strong> for the next round, if applicable.</p>
<p>In addition to pool advancements, points are earned after each match depending on standing and pool.</p>

<h2>Playoffs Format</h2>
<p>After the Group Stage, the <strong>top 27 players</strong> will compete in a single-elimination winner-takes-all bracket consisting of the <strong>Quarter-Finals (27 players)</strong>, <strong>Semi-Finals (9 players)</strong>, and <strong>Finals (3 players)</strong>.</p>
<p>Estimated tournament runtime:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Round 1: Sept 15 - 24</li>
  <li>Round 2: Sept 25 - Oct 5</li>
  <li>Round 3: Oct 6 - 16</li>
  <li>Quarter-Finals: Oct 16 - 23</li>
  <li>Semi-Finals: Oct 23 - 30</li>
  <li>Finals: early Nov</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ascension Swiss Scoring</h2>
<p>Each round in the Group Stage will see all competitors be matched in a 3-player race with other competitors from their same bracket. There may be some 2-player races possible due to bracket imbalances, but will be minimized where possible.</p>
