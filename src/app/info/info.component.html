<h2>Format</h2>
<p>This year, we'll be using running a new format called <strong>Ascension Swiss</strong>. Unlike previous years, there will not be a <strong>one-round seeding round</strong>.</p>
<p>Instead, there will be a <strong>Group Stage of three races</strong> for all competitors. The first round of the group stage will see matches of 2-3 racers formed completely randomly, minimizing the number of 2-player races.</p>
<p>After the <strong>first round</strong>, all the <strong>winners</strong> will make their way to the <strong>Ascension Pool</strong>, while the remaining racers remain in the <strong>Normal Pool</strong>.</p>
<p>For the <strong>remaining two rounds of the Group Stage</strong>, players will be placed in races drawn from players in their respective Pool (Ascension/Normal). Winners in the <strong>Ascension Pool</strong> will advance straight to the Quarter-Finals, while winning a race in the <strong>Normal Pool</strong> will grant advancement to the next round's <strong>Ascension Pool</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition to Pool Advancements, <strong>all racers</strong> will earn points based on their performance during each round in the Group Stage, as shown later.</p>
<p>After the Group Stage, the <strong>top 27 players</strong> will compete in a single-elimination winner-takes-all bracket consisting of the <strong>Quarter-Finals</strong>, <strong>Semi-Finals</strong>, and <strong>Finals</strong>.</p>
<p>Estimated tournament runtime:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Round 1: Sept 15 - 24</li>
  <li>Round 2: Sept 25 - Oct 5</li>
  <li>Round 3: Oct 6 - 16</li>
  <li>Quarter-Finals: Oct 16 - 23</li>
  <li>Semi-Finals: Oct 23 - 30</li>
  <li>Finals: early Nov</li>
</ul>

<h2>Group Stage</h2>
<p>Each round in the Group Stage will see all competitors be matched in a 3-player race with other competitors from their same bracket. There may be some 2-player races possible due to bracket imbalances, but will be minimized where possible.</p>
<p>Everyone begins in the <strong>Normal Pool</strong> for the first round, with the following point distributions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Winner</strong>: 10 points <strong>and advancement to Ascension Pool</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Middle*</strong>: 6 points</li>
  <li><strong>Bottom</strong>: 0 points</li>
</ul>
<p><i>* Only applies to 2nd place in 3-player races. Coming in 2nd in a 2-player race is considered <strong>bottom position</strong></i></p>

<p>In the second and third rounds, here are the point distributions for each position.</p>

<h2>Tiebreakers</h2>
<p>In general, tiebreakers will <strong>not be resolved</strong>, and all players with the same point totals will share positions.</p>
<p>The exception is when the number of players with equal or more points than the <strong>racer in 27th position</strong> exceeds 27. In this case, every player with the same points total as the <strong>27th position</strong> will play a tiebreaker match to determine advancement to the <strong>Quarter-Finals</strong></p>
<p>The top X players from the tiebreaker match will advance to the <strong>Quarter-Finals</strong>, where X = 27 - K, where K is the number of players with more points than the number of points in shared 27th position.</p>
<p><i>For example, if 25 players have over 20 points, and the 26-29 position players all have 18 points, the tiebreaker match will consist of four races with two advancing to the Quarter-Finals.</i></p>

<h2>Top Cut</h2>
<p>After the Swiss rounds, the top 27 players will advance to nine (9) Quarter-Finals matches, with the winners moving on to three (3) Semi-Finals matches. Winners of the Semi-Finals advance to the Finals.</p>
<p>For the <strong>Quarter-Finals</strong>, players will be ordered and then placed into <strong>three pots</strong> in order. Earning advancement in Round 2 earns the highest seed, followed by earning a Bye in Round 3, followed by highest point total. Ties for seeding go in favor of the runner with the better tournament personal best. Each match will consist of a player from each pot.</p>
